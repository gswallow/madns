# Responds with an OPT additional record containing higher error bits that
# (combined with the four bits in the Flags field of the header) results in an
# error RCODE of 4000, which is in the “Reserved for Private Use” range of
# RCODEs.
#
# DNS clients should register this response as an error, despite the fact that
# the four RCODE bits in the Flags field are all still set to zero.


# DNS header
# (minus transaction ID)
Flags: 81 80  # the RCODE bits here are still zero
